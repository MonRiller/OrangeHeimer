## Stage 1: Oranco Mining Web Server Exploitation
### Objective
Exploit web server and set up connection to internal relay SSH
### Files:
- orangeland.py
- stage1.rc
### IPs and Ports:
All can be customized in stage1.rc file
- thrower box 10.0.1.21:4444
- oranco Web 10.0.1.1:8443
- thrower SSH 127.0.0.1:22
- relay SSH 172.31.82.221:22
### How to Run:
- chmod +x orangeland.py
- move orangeland.py into metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/modules/exploits/unix/webapp/
- msfconsole -r exploit.rc -- may need to be run with sudo
### Possible Failures and Solutions:
Orangeland.py has been tested on multiple ops and should work, if it doesnâ€™t, then verbally harass the analysts.  
Portfwd add is the only new command, if this fails:
- verify that the SSH server is running at the IP and port as indicated, if they are different, re run the portfwd command with -p <SSH_PORT> -r <SSH_IP>
- run shell in meterpreter, upgrade using python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")', and verify that the SSH credentials work
- run the portfwd command with a different thrower port using -l <THROW_PORT> Note, this means that all future SSH commands cannot use sshpass and must use -p <THROW_PORT>  
## Stage 2: Setting up Network Communication
### Objective
Set up direct communication between orangeland and device controller using SSH port forwarding
### Files:
- stage2.sh
### IPs and Ports
Can be customized by editing stage2.sh
- thorwer SSH 127.0.0.1:22
- relay SSH 172.31.82.221:22
- thorwer -> controller port forward 127.0.0.1:4200 -> 172.31.86.120:8080
- first relay SSH -> thrower port forward (from controller) 172.100.0.1:4242 -> 127.0.0.1:4201
- second relay SSH -> thrower port forward (from controller) 172.100.0.1:4243 -> 127.0.0.1:4202
### How to Run:
- run and verify stage 1
- ./stage2.sh
- verify success by opening http://localhost:4200 in web browser, it should return "Forbidden"
### Possible Failures and Solutions:
For some reason, we cannot SSH from localhost. If this happens:
- run shell in meterpreter
- upgrade using python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
- SSH into the server with ssh -Nf missileadmin@172.31.81.221
- run SSH reconfiguration commands and verify success
- execute port forwarding commands, using 10.0.1.1 instead of 127.0.0.1
  
An error occurs in the reconfiguration of the SSH server. If this happens:
- SSH into the server from localhost
- Check if /etc/ssh/sshd_config has 'GatewayPorts yes' in its last line, if not then sudo su and add it
- Restart ssh service, this can be done with "service ssh restart" or "systemctl restart ssh"
- Continue with normal port forwarding commands

The commands execute normally, but no response is received from http://localhost:4200
- SSH into the server from localhost
- Run "netstat -plant", check if the output contains a TCP listener on 0.0.0.0:4242
- If the netstat does contain the TCP listener, it indicates that the mastersockets works. Verify that the controller is up and has the correct IP address with the analysts. Then attempt to rerun the first mastersockets command.
- If the netstat has the TCP listener on 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0, then the server is not configured properly. Go through the confiugration remediation steps.
- If the netstat has no TCP listener on port 4242, then attempt to set up the port forwarding as sudo on the server.
